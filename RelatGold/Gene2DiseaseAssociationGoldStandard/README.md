Project Title: Gene2DiseaseAssociationGoldStandard


Introduction: The Gene2DiseaseAssociationGoldStandard project is meant for extracting gene-disease associations from two resources, namely the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and PharmGKB. The project also compiles a unique list of associations from both resources.  


Prerequisites: The resource files can be downloaded from CTD and PharmGKB. While the resource from CTD is freely available, the resource from PharmGKB requires a license and can be obtained by contacting the PharmGKB team. We use Homo_sapiens.gene_info file from Entrez Gene for identifying gene symbols associated with Human.
The file can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/. 


---- RUN IN AN IDE ----

The entire project should be pulled into a Java IDE, such as Eclipse. The execution of the project starts from the main method within each package.


---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

Processing includes Java programs and Linux commands. Please see Documentation/Gene_disease_association.docx.


Java version used for development: JavaSE-1.8
