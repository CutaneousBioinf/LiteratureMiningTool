Project Title: Drug2Gene2PathwayCompiler


Introduction: 
The project is meant to extract pathways for drugs through genes. We processed three different resources, namely Reactome, BioCarta (also known as CGAP), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

The entire project should be pulled into a Java IDE, such as Eclipse. The execution of the project starts from the main method within each package and is documented clearly.
