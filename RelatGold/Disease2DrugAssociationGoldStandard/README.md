Project Title: Disease2DrugAssociationGoldStandard


Introduction: Disease2DrugAssociationGoldStandard project is meant to extract disease-drug associations from two resources namely Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT). The project also compiles a unique list of associations from both resources.  


Prerequisites: The resource files should be downloaded from CTD, and NDF-RT. While CTD provides free access to download the entire data, downloading the data from NDF-RT bioportal is challenging. Alternatively, we can downloaded NDF-RT data available within UMLS Metahesaurus, a collection of biomedical concepts from around 200 dictionaries. In addition to the resource files, this project requires UMLS Metathesaurus to map unique concept identifier (CUI) to disease name and our own chemicals/drugs dictionary to map the customized ID to chemical/drug name. Downloading and installation of UMLS Metathesaurus requires license (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/). Please refer to https://github.com/CutaneousBioinf/LiteratureMiningTool/tree/master/ConceptMap for processing of UMLS Metathesaurus. Chemicals/drugs lexicon is compiled from three resources namely UMLS Metathesaurus, DrugBank and PharmGKB. Please refer to https://github.com/CutaneousBioinf/LiteratureMiningTool/tree/master/DrugDict.  


---- RUN IN AN IDE ----

The entire project should be pulled into Java IDE, such as eclipse. The execution of the project starts from main method within each package and documented clearly.


---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

Processing includes Java programs and Linux commands. Please see Documentation/Disease_drug_assoication.docx. 


Java version used for development: JavaSE-1.8
