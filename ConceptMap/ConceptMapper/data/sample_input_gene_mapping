10359813	MRP3, an organic anion transporter able to transport anti-cancer drugs.
10359813	The human multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) gene family contains at least six members: MRP1, encoding the multidrug-resistance protein; MRP2 or cMOAT, encoding the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter; and four homologs, called MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and MRP6. 
10359813	In this report, we characterize MRP3, the closest homolog of MRP1. 
10359813	Cell lines were retrovirally transduced with MRP3 cDNA, and new monoclonal antibodies specific for MRP3 were generated. 
10359813	We show that MRP3 is an organic anion and multidrug transporter, like the GS-X pumps MRP1 and MRP2. 
10359813	In Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells, MRP3 routes to the basolateral membrane and mediates transport of the organic anion S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl-)glutathione toward the basolateral side of the monolayer. 
10359813	In ovarian carcinoma cells (2008), expression of MRP3 results in low-level resistance to the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide. 
10359813	In short-term drug exposure experiments, MRP3 also confers high-level resistance to methotrexate. 
10359813	Neither 2008 cells nor Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells overexpressing MRP3 showed an increase in glutathione export or a decrease in the level of intracellular glutathione, in contrast to cells overexpressing MRP1 or MRP2. 
10359813	We discuss the possible function of MRP3 in (hepatic) physiology and its potential contribution to drug resistance of cancer cells.
10446858	Selective expression of folate receptor beta and its possible role in methotrexate transport in synovial macrophages from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
10446858	To investigate the expression of folate receptors (FR) and reduced folate carrier (RFC) and determine their relevance to methotrexate (MTX) transport in synovial mononuclear cells (SMC) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
10446858	Levels of folate receptors and reduced folate carrier messenger RNA (mRNA) were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in synovial mononuclear cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. 
10446858	Expression of FR-beta messenger RNA and protein was determined by Northern blot and Western blot analyses in rheumatoid arthritis synovial mononuclear cells and monocyte / macrophage-lineage cells. 
10446858	FR-beta expression and folic acid binding capacity on the cell surface were examined by flow cytometric analysis and 3H-folic acid binding analysis. 
10446858	Studies of the inhibition of 3H-methotrexate uptake in the presence of unlabeled folic acid were performed to investigate the uptake of methotrexate through folate receptors in rheumatoid arthritis SMC. 
10446858	RT-PCR, Northern blot, and Western blot analyses showed that FR-beta messenger RNA and protein were expressed selectively in activated monocytes and CD14+ rheumatoid arthritis SMC. 
10446858	These cells exhibited folic acid binding capacity. 
10446858	Furthermore, the FR-beta protein was shown to have folic acid binding capacity. 
10446858	Uptake of 3H-MTX through rheumatoid arthritis synovial mononuclear cells was significantly inhibited in the presence of unlabeled folic acid. 
10446858	These results demonstrate that FR-beta expression is selectively elevated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial macrophages and suggest that methotrexate is transported through FR-beta in rheumatoid arthritis synovial macrophages. 
10446858	The findings suggest that folate antagonists with higher affinity for FR-beta would be useful in the treatment of RA.
11027569	Correction of glycogen storage disease type II by enzyme replacement with a recombinant human acid maltase produced by over-expression in a CHO-DHFR(neg) cell line.
11027569	Inherited genetic deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha glucosidase or acid maltase (GAA) results in the autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II). 
11027569	To investigate whether we could generate a functional recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) for enzyme replacement therapy, we subcloned the cDNAs for human GAA and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into DHFR(neg) Chinese hamster ovary cells and established a stable cotransformant that expressed rhGAA. 
11027569	We cultured the recombinant cells in media with progressively increasing concentrations of methotrexate and found that human GAA enzyme activity increased to over 2,000 IU per gram protein. 
11027569	Importantly, the human GAA enzyme activity correlated to equivalent amounts of human GAA protein by rocketimmunoelectrophoresis. 
11027569	We confirmed that the human GAA enzyme activity corresponded to an amplification in human GAA mRNA by Northern analysis and human GAA cDNA copy number by Southern analysis. 
11027569	Exposing the recombinant human GAA to human GSDII fibroblast cells or patient's lymphocytes or monocytes resulted in uptake of the recombinant human GAA and reversal of the enzymatic defect. 
11027569	Mannose-6-phosphate in the media blocked uptake. 
11027569	GAA - / - mice were treated with the recombinant human GAA at 1 mg / kg, which resulted in heterozygous levels of GAA in tissues, most notably skeletal muscle, heart and diaphragm after two infusions. 
11027569	More importantly, after multiple infusions, hind, and fore-limb muscle weakness was reversed. 
11027569	This recombinant human GAA would be ideal for enzyme replacement therapy in GSD II.
11375950	LST-2, a human liver-specific organic anion transporter, determines methotrexate sensitivity in gastrointestinal cancers.
11375950	One approach to the development of targeted cancer chemotherapy exploits increased uptake of the agent into neoplastic cells. 
11375950	In this scenario, higher concentrations of the agent in cancer cells are responsible for differential killing, whereas the low concentration in normal human cells decreases side effects. 
11375950	The aim of this study was to isolate an organic anion transporter that is weak in normal cells, but abundantly expressed in cancer cells, to deliver the anticancer drugs to the cells. 
11375950	A human liver complementary DNA (complementary DNA) library was screened with liver-specific transporter (LST)-1 complementary DNA as a probe. 
11375950	Northern blot analyses were performed using the isolated complementary DNA (termed LST-2). 
11375950	An LST-2-specific antibody was raised, and immunohistochemical analyses including immunoelectron microscopy were performed. 
11375950	Xenopus oocyte expression system was used for functional analysis. 
11375950	We also established a permanent cell line that consistently expresses LST-2 to examine the relationship between methotrexate uptake and sensitivity. 
11375950	The isolated cDNA, LST-2, has 79.7% of overall homology with human LST-1. 
11375950	LST-2 exclusively expressed in the liver under normal conditions and its immunoreactivity was highest at the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes around the central vein. 
11375950	Although its weak expression in the liver, LST-2 is abundantly expressed in the gastric, colon, and pancreatic cancers. 
11375950	On the other hand, the LST-1 was only detected in a hepatic cell line. 
11375950	LST-2 transports methotrexate in a saturable and dose-dependent manner. 
11375950	Furthermore, introduction of the LST-2 gene into mammalian cells potentiates sensitivity to methotrexate. 
11375950	LST-2 is one of the prime candidate molecules for determining methotrexate sensitivity and may be a good target to deliver anticancer drugs to the gastrointestinal cancers.
12812497	A bifunctional molecule that displays context-dependent cellular activity.
12812497	The cell-permeable dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate was covalently linked to a ligand for the protein FKBP to create a bifunctional molecule called MTXSLF. 
12812497	The covalent tether between the two ligands was designed to be prohibitively short, so that unfavorable protein-protein interactions between DHFR and FKBP preclude formation of a trimeric complex. 
12812497	In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that MTXSLF is an effective inhibitor of human DHFR, but that efficacy is decreased in the presence of human FKBP due to the high concentration of FKBP and its tight affinity for MTXSLF. 
12812497	MTXSLF also inhibits Plasmodium falciparum DHFR in vitro, but a low concentration of the weaker binding Plasmodium FKBP has no effect on the inhibitory potency of MTXSLF in vivo. 
12812497	These studies illustrate a potentially general strategy for modulating the biological activity of synthetic molecules that depends on the ligand-binding properties of a nontarget protein.
