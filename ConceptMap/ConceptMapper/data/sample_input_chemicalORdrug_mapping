23790018	Efficacy of adalimumab across subgroups of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet: post hoc analysis of REACH.
23790018	The Randomized Controlled Evaluation of Adalimumab in Treatment of Chronic Plaque Psoriasis of the Hands and Feet (REACH) trial demonstrated that adalimumab was efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of hand and / or foot psoriasis through 28 weeks. 
23790018	To evaluate the effects of patient baseline characteristics on efficacy of adalimumab treatment of hand and / or foot psoriasis. 
23790018	Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and / or feet were randomized 2 : 1 to adalimumab or placebo during the 16 week, double-blind period of REACH. 
23790018	Primary endpoint was percentage of patients achieving Physician's Global Assessment of the hands and / or feet of clear / almost clear at week 16. 
23790018	Post hoc analyses evaluated effects of baseline patient characteristics on the primary endpoint. 
23790018	Patients with nail psoriasis at baseline were assessed for association of Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) 50 response with efficacy outcomes at week 16. 
23790018	Seventy-two patients (49 adalimumab : 23 placebo) were analysed. 
23790018	Greater percentages of adalimumab-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint vs. placebo across all subgroups. 
23790018	Among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 50 (56.5%) vs. placebo (12.5%) at week 16. 
23790018	In adalimumab-treated patients, greater percentages of Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 50 Responders vs. 
23790018	Non-responders achieved the primary endpoint, and had greater improvements in erythema, scaling, induration and fissuring, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and pain scores. 
23790018	Adalimumab was efficacious in treating chronic plaque psoriasis of the hands and / or feet over 16 weeks, regardless of baseline characteristics. 
23790018	Marked improvement in nail psoriasis among adalimumab-treated patients correlated with significant improvements in skin disease and patient-reported outcomes.
23891453	Guidelines for the use of acitretin in psoriasis. 
23891453	Psoriasis Group of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.
23891453	Phototherapy, classic systemic treatments (methotrexate, acitretin, and ciclosporin), and biologic agents (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab) constitute a broad therapeutic arsenal that increases the likelihood of achieving control of severe and extensive disease in patients with psoriasis. 
23891453	Acitretin continues to be a very valuable tool in both monotherapy, in which it is combined with other systemic treatments (classic or biologic), and in sequential therapy. 
23891453	Thanks to its lack of a direct immunosuppressive effect and its ability to achieve a long-term response, acitretin has an important role in the treatment of psoriasis, although this has not always been acknowledged in relevant treatment guidelines. 
23891453	We present consensus guidelines for the use of acitretin in psoriasis drawn up by the Psoriasis Group of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. 
23891453	These guidelines provide a detailed account of acitretin, including pharmacological properties, indications and contraindications, adverse effects, and factors that should be taken into account to enhance the safe use of this drug. 
23891453	They also propose treatment strategies for use in routine clinical practice. 
23891453	The overall aim of these guidelines is to define the criteria for the use and management of acetretin in psoriasis.
24079852	Impact of brodalumab treatment on psoriasis symptoms and health-related quality of life: use of a novel patient-reported outcome measure, the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory.
24079852	Psoriasis symptoms have a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life, impairing physical functioning and well-being. 
24079852	To evaluate the impact of brodalumab, a human anti-interleukin-17R monoclonal antibody, on psoriasis symptom severity as measured by a novel patient-reported outcome measure, the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory, and dermatology-specific health-related quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). 
24079852	This was a secondary analysis of a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (n = 198) treated with brodalumab or placebo. 
24079852	This analysis assessed Psoriasis Symptom Inventory scores and Dermatology Life Quality Index scores over time. 
24079852	Analyses were conducted on all patients who were randomized and received one or more injections of the study drug according to intention to treat using last observation carried forward to impute missing data. 
24079852	At week 12, subjects in the brodalumab groups had significant improvements in mean Psoriasis Symptom Inventory total scores [8.5 (70 mg), 15.8 (140 mg), 16.2 (210 mg) and 12.7 (280 mg)] compared with placebo (4.8). 
24079852	Mean improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index were clinically meaningful (≥ 5.7) in the brodalumab groups (6.2, 9.1, 9.6 and 7.1, respectively) and significantly greater than placebo (3.1). 
24079852	Improvements in Psoriasis Symptom Inventory were observed as early as week 2 and in Dermatology Life Quality Index by week 4. 
24079852	All eight Psoriasis Symptom Inventory item scores improved significantly among the brodalumab groups by week 12. 
24079852	Results were from a single randomized clinical trial and may not generalize to broader patient populations. 
24079852	However, treatment with brodalumab provided significant improvement in psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
