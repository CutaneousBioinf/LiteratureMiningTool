21153725	Perturbations of ground support alter posture and locomotion coupling during step initiation in Parkinson's disease.
21153725	During the initiation of stepping, anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) for lateral weight transfer and propulsion normally precede the onset of locomotion. 
21153725	In Parkinson's disease (PD), impaired step initiation typically involves altered APA ground force production with delayed step onset and deficits in stepping performance. 
21153725	If, as in stance and gait, sensory information about lower limb load is important for the control of stepping, then perturbations influencing loading conditions could affect the step initiation process. 
21153725	This study investigated the influence of changes in lower limb loading during step initiation in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects. 
21153725	Participants performed rapid self-triggered step initiation with the impending single stance limb positioned over a pneumatically actuated platform. 
21153725	In perturbation trials, the stance limb ground support surface was either moved vertically downward (DROP) or upward (ELEVATE) by 1.5 cm shortly after the onset of the APA phase. 
21153725	Overall, Parkinson's disease patients demonstrated a longer APA duration, longer time to first step onset, and slower step speed than controls. 
21153725	In both groups, the DROP perturbation reinforced the intended APA kinetic changes for lateral weight transfer and resulted in a significant reduction in APA duration, increase in peak amplitude, and earlier time to first step onset compared with other conditions. 
21153725	During ELEVATE trials that opposed the intended weight transfer forces both groups rapidly adapted their stepping to preserve standing stability by decreasing step length and duration, and increasing step height and foot placement laterally. 
21153725	The findings suggested that sensory information associated with limb load and / or foot pressure modulates the spatial and temporal parameters of posture and locomotion components of step initiation in interaction with a centrally generated feedforward mode of neural control. 
21153725	Moreover, impaired step initiation in Parkinson's disease may at least acutely be enhanced by augmenting the coupling between posture and locomotion.
21153733	One-year evaluation of factors affecting the biological activity of interferon beta in multiple sclerosis patients.
21153733	MxA is an antiviral protein induced by type I interferons (IFN) and some viruses; MxA gene expression is an appropriate marker for measuring biologic activity of exogenous IFNβ, as its induction indicates IFNAR receptor stimulation. 
21153733	A recent study has shown that measurement of MxA mRNA, after 1 year of treatment, predicts clinical responsiveness to IFNβ therapy. 
21153733	Loss of IFNβ bioactivity is mostly due to anti-IFNβ antibodies (both neutralizing and binding), non-compliance and receptor saturation. 
21153733	The aim of this study was to evaluate all possible causes of loss of IFNβ bioactivity after 1 year in treated patients. 
21153733	One hundred sixty-seven multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were included. 
21153733	One year after beginning IFNβ therapy, each patient underwent a blood test; MxA gene expression was measured by real time PCR, antiviral CPE assay to detect neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and capture-ELISA (cELISA) to measure binding antibodies (BAbs). 
21153733	For MxA an upper normal threshold of 87 (RE) was considered, 20 TRU / mL was the threshold for NAbs, and 1 U for binding antibodies positivity. 
21153733	Thirty-seven out of 167 patients (22%) were MxA-negative; of these, 22 were both binding antibodies and NAbs+, whereas 12 were binding antibodies+ but Nabs-, and three were both binding antibodies and NAbs-. 
21153733	The following conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) MxA mRNA should be measured after 1 year of interferonsβ therapy; (2) after 1 year of interferonsβ treatment, absence of interferonsβ bioactivity was detected in 22% of the patients; (3) different biological phenomena and reduced compliance explain this absence; (4) identification of the reason for absence of interferons bioactivity improves patients' management.
21153764	Missing genetic information in case-control family data with general semi-parametric shared frailty model.
21153764	Case-control family data are now widely used to examine the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex diseases. 
21153764	In these types of studies, exposure levels are obtained retrospectively and, frequently, information on most risk factors of interest is available on the probands but not on their relatives. 
21153764	In this work we consider correlated failure time data arising from population-based case-control family studies with missing genotypes of relatives. 
21153764	We present a new method for estimating the age-dependent marginalized hazard function. 
21153764	The proposed technique has two major advantages: (1) it is based on the pseudo full likelihood function rather than a pseudo composite likelihood function, which usually suffers from substantial efficiency loss; (2) the cumulative baseline hazard function is estimated using a two-stage estimator instead of an iterative process. 
21153764	We assess the performance of the proposed methodology with simulation studies, and illustrate its utility on a real data example.
21153765	Asian Americans and obesity in California: a protective effect of biculturalism.
21153765	Prior studies comparing US-born and foreign-born Asian Americans have shown that birth in the US conveys greater risk of obesity. 
21153765	Our study investigates whether retention of Asian culture might be protective for obesity despite acculturation to US lifestyle. 
21153765	We classified self-identified Asian American respondents of the California Health Interview Survey as traditional, bicultural, and acculturated using nativity and language proficiency in English and Asian language. 
21153765	We then examined the association of acculturation with overweight / obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg / m²) in a multivariate regression model. 
21153765	Acculturated respondents had higher adjusted odds of being overweight / obese than bicultural respondents (2.13 [1.40-3.23] for men, 3.28 [2.14-5.04] for women), but bicultural respondents had similar odds of being overweight / obese as traditional respondents (.98 [.69-1.41] for men, .72 [.50-1.05] for women). 
21153765	Among the bicultural, second and first generation respondents were equally likely to be overweight / obese. 
21153765	Biculturalism in Asian Americans as measured by Asian language retention appears protective against obesity. 
21153765	Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this association.
21153771	Serum lipoprotein(a) levels are greater in female than male patients with type-2 diabetes.
21153771	Women with diabetes are faced with a higher risk of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disorders than men with diabetes. 
21153771	We aimed to study the role of gender and menopausal status in serum Lp(a) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
21153771	We quantified serum Lp(a) levels in a group of 477 patients with type 2 diabetes (men, premenopausal and postmenopausal women with diabetes), as well as in 105 controls. 
21153771	We stratified the patients into two groups of low Lp(a) levels (Lp(a) &lt;35 mg / dl) and elevated Lp(a) levels (Lp(a) &gt;35 mg / dl). 
21153771	Patients with diabetes had higher serum Lp(a) levels than the controls. 
21153771	Serum Lp(a) levels was significantly higher in women with diabetes than men with diabetes. 
21153771	Lp(a) levels did not differ between male and females in the control group. 
21153771	Premenopausal and postmenopausal women with diabetes did not differ significantly in serum Lp(a) levels. 
21153771	The odds ratio of having a serum Lp(a) level higher than 35 was 5.85 in premenopausal women with diabetes, 5.08 in postmenopausal women with diabetes, 2.41 in men with diabetes and 1.9 in the women in the control group compared to the men in the control group, after adjustment for age and BMI. 
21153771	This observational study clearly indicated that serum Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in women and men with diabetes. 
21153771	The increase in women was independent of menopause. 
21153771	The level of serum Lp(a) had no correlation with lipid parameters in men or women.
