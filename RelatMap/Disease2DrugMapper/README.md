Project Title: Disease2DrugMapper


Introduction: The Disease2DrugMapper project is meant to map diseases, chemicals/drugs and their synonyms in a sentence from PubMed abstracts. It also filters the sentences mapped with a disease and a chemical/drug.  


Prerequisites: 

** Disease lexicon and chemical/drug lexicon are required to run the project. Disease lexicon can be generated from UMLS Metathesaurus by using semantic types related to diseases (refer to ConceptMap:UMLSMetathesaurusCompiler for related Java codes). 
NOTE: Please refer to https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/ for license requirements, download and installation of UMLS Metathesaurus.

** Chemical/drug lexicon is required to run the project. The lexicon can be compiled from three resources, namely UMLS Metathesaurus, DrugBank, and PharmGKB (refer to DrugDict:DrugsDictionaryCompiler and ConceptMap:UMLSMetathesaurusCompiler for related Java codes). 

** The project also requires a local version of the PubMed database (Please refer to ConceptMap:LocalPubmedDatabaseCompiler and ConceptMap:PubMedXMLParser for related Java codes).

** MedTagger is required for executing the code and it has to be merged with our Java code (e.g. src/edu/mayo/nlp/). MedTagger is meant for indexing biomedical concepts (e.g. disease, chemical, drug) based on a lexicon and is distributed as an Open Health Natural Language Processing project (OHNLP).

** The project requires a range of existing Java libraries: apache-logging-log4j.jar, commons-lang-2.3.jar, commons-logging-1.1.1.jar, org.apache.commons.io.jar, Stanford lexical parser and Apache Lucene (version 5.1.0 or above). You can download them from the respective contributor's URL and add to the project's build path.  


---- RUN IN AN IDE ----

The entire project can be pulled into a Java IDE, such as Eclipse. You can compile the file Disease2DrugMapper/edu/uom/med/diseaseDrugMapper/DiseaseDrugMapper.java.


---- COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE ----

Mapping of diseases can be achieved with the following commands:
						
						javac DiseaseDrugMapper.java 
						java DiseaseDrugMapper INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Alternatively, you can generate a jar file of the entire project (DiseaseDrugMapper.jar, for example) and execute the jar file from the command line using the standard command. 

						java -jar DiseaseDrugMapper.jar INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE


Input: The input is one or more sentences assigned with ID (see data/sample_input). Please refer to the ConceptMap:LocalPubmedDatabaseCompiler project for creating a local version of PubMed database and the ConceptMap:PubMedXMLParser project for splitting an abstract into individual sentences.

Output: The output displays the mapped disease, chemical/drug, disease ID (e.g. CUI from UMLS Metathesaurus) and chemical/drug ID (e.g. ID from the lexicon). Please see data/sample_output.


Java version used for development: JavaSE-1.8
